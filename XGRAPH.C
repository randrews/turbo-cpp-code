 * LIB.C v1.2
 *
 * by Robert Schmidt
 * (C)1993 Ztiff Zox Softwear
 *
 * Simple graphics library to accompany the article
 * 
 *			INTRODUCTION TO MODE X.
 * 
 * This library provides the basic functions for initializing and using
 * unchained (planar) 256-color VGA modes.  Currently supported are:
 *
 *	- 320x200
 *	- 320x240
 *
 * Functions are provided for:
 *
 *	- initializing one of the available modes
 *	- setting the start address of the VGA refresh data
 *	- setting active and visible display pages
 *	- writing and reading a single pixel to/from video memory
 *
 * The library is provided as a demonstration only, and is not claimed
 * to be particularly efficient or suited for any purpose.  It has only
 * been tested with Borland C++ 3.1 by the author.  Comments on success
 * or disaster with other compilers are welcome.
 *
 * This file is public domain.  Do with it whatever you'd like, but
 * please don't distribute it without the article.
 *
 * Thanks go out to various helpful netters who spotted the 0xE7 bug
 * in the set320x240x256() function!
